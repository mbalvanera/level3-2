I want to be the<br> shore kissed by<br> the sea, I want to<br> have everything<br> causally, I want you<br> and me.

I want to be your perfect scent, your missed rent,<br> those days you feel you need to repent.<br> 
I want you to listen to these cheesy rhymes,<br> feeding me these sweet lines, be together all the time.<br> 
I want to be your dark brown hair, the place<br> back when we didn't care, the memories only we share.
        </p>
        <p>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I want you in all the ways I can say. 
I'll want you forever and always each and every day. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I never knew you could know me so much better
I ignored all the great weather 
the darkest<br> cloud hung over me and I let my head fall on the air
my hair was still wet but not the day that we met
        </p>
        <p class="three">
Was it someone like you who did it to be so kind
Leaves on the grass with words drawn out
You admired me and wanted to hold my hand
I let the curtains fly in
Didn’t want the wind to pass me by

Wearing the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans
Dropping love on my sleeve
Too many wishes that I hope they’re not an omen
I never knew a heart could beat for me
        </p>
